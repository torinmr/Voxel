This is my attempt to make a Minecraft clone using WebGL and Javascript. It's not in a very functional state at the moment - it generates a fairly large statically-sized world that can be explored in fly mode, supports block creation and destruction, and has a simple directional lighting model. However, there is no collision detection implemented yet, so it's not much fun to explore.

Also, I haven't done any testing except in Chrome, and I believe the WASD controls are set to Dvorak mode at the moment...

Anyway, WASD to move, mouse to look, enter to switch to fly mode.
