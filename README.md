=====

This is my attempt to make a Minecraft clone using WebGL and Javascript, using only minimal third-party libraries. For example, I use raw shaders instead of three.js or anything similar for rendering. It's not in a very functional state at the moment - it generates a fairly large statically-sized world that can be explored in fly mode, supports block creation and destruction, and has a simple directional lighting model. However, there is no collision detection implemented yet, so it's not much fun to explore.

Also, I haven't done any testing except in Chrome, so beware...

*Controls*

WASD to move, mouse to look around.

Press Enter to switch to a different movement mode (similar to Minecraft's fly mode), where WASD moves you only horizontally, and Q and R go up and down.

Press 0 to switch to Dvorak-friendly controls.
